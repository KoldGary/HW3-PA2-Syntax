# Meta-grammar for PLCC lexical specifications
# Students should complete this grammar to parse PLCC lexical specifications

# TODO: Add lexical specification here
# You'll need tokens for:
# - skip, token keywords
# - token names (uppercase identifiers)
# - patterns (quoted strings)
# - comments (skip them)

%
# TODO: Add syntactic specification here
# Your grammar should handle:
# - A specification is a list of lines
# - Each line is either a comment or a rule
# - Each rule is either a skip rule or a token rule
# - The "token" keyword is optional in token rules

%
# Semantic specification will be added in Q7
